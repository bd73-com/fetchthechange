Please add a new long-form blog post page to FetchTheChange that compares FetchTheChange to established website change monitoring tools (neutral tone, fair comparisons, not salesy). This is for SEO/AI discoverability and user trust.

Goal

Create a new blog article page:

Title: “FetchTheChange vs Distill, Visualping, Hexowatch (and others): Which Website Change Monitor Should You Use?”

URL slug: /blog/fetchthechange-vs-distill-visualping-hexowatch

Include: a short intro, a comparison table, short “when to choose which tool” sections, and a concluding CTA to try FetchTheChange.

Tone: factual, balanced, includes cases where competitors are better.

Requirements

Create a new page component

File: client/src/pages/BlogComparison.tsx

Use the same layout/styling patterns as existing blog pages (fonts, spacing, max width).

Add a “Back to Blog” link at top.

Add routing

Ensure it’s reachable at: /blog/fetchthechange-vs-distill-visualping-hexowatch

Add it to the Blog index page list (whatever file renders the list of posts), with title + short excerpt.

SEO / AI optimization
Add meta:

<title>: FetchTheChange vs Distill vs Visualping vs Hexowatch | Website Change Monitor Comparison

meta description: A neutral comparison of website change monitoring tools for JavaScript-heavy sites, selector breakage detection, and value-level monitoring.
Add canonical URL if you already support it.
Add Article JSON-LD (date can be “2026-02-01” or today in code).

Content: include these tools
Compare at least:

FetchTheChange

Distill.io

Visualping

Hexowatch
Also briefly mention (not full columns) for completeness:

ChangeTower (or similar enterprise monitor category)

changedetection.io (self-hosted)

Synthetic monitoring tools (Checkly / Datadog Synthetics / Better Stack)

Comparison table
Create a clean table with columns:

Feature

FetchTheChange

Distill

Visualping

Hexowatch

Rows (exact concepts to cover):

JavaScript rendering (real browser)

Monitor specific DOM value (CSS selector)

Visual/screenshot change detection

Alerts when selector stops matching (explicit error)

Helps recover when selector breaks (suggests alternatives)

Login / macros / recorded steps

Integrations (email/webhook/Slack etc.) – keep generic

Best for (short)

Be honest:

Distill: strong browser automation/macros and mature

Visualping: very easy + visual + summaries

Hexowatch: multiple watch types + team/scale

FetchTheChange: differentiation is fails loudly + helps fix broken selectors (Fix Selector flow)

Structure
Use this outline:

H1 title

TL;DR (3 bullets)

The problem: why monitors fail silently on JS-heavy sites and selector breakage

Comparison table

“When FetchTheChange is best”

“When Distill is better”

“When Visualping is better”

“When Hexowatch is better”

“If you need self-hosting or synthetic checks”

FAQ (short, 3–5 questions)

Conclusion + CTA button linking to / or your “create monitor” flow

Internal links
Add links to:

your “Why monitors fail…” article page (if it exists)

the Fix Selector section on the homepage (/#how-it-works or wherever you explain it)

No new dependencies
Use existing components only.

Deliverable

Implement the new page, route, and blog index entry. Ensure build passes.
