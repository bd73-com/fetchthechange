# FetchTheChange

**Monitor any web value. Get alerted when it changes.**

FetchTheChange is a reliable website change-monitoring tool that works even on modern, JavaScript-heavy sites where most trackers fail.

Whether you're tracking prices, availability, numbers, text, or status messages — FetchTheChange watches exactly what *you* care about and tells you when it changes.
