You are my senior full-stack engineer. Implement a canonical “Blog Article” page on my app website based on my Dev.to post:
https://dev.to/bd73/why-website-change-monitors-fail-silently-on-javascript-heavy-sites-and-how-to-detect-it-before-it-e61

Goal:
- Add a public, SEO-optimized blog page on my own domain
- Keep it generic (about website change monitoring), not a price tracker
- Make my site the canonical source for this content (so Dev.to is the syndicated copy)
- Add proper SEO meta tags and optional structured data
- Add a link from the landing page to the article

Constraints:
- Use the existing stack (React/Vite UI with the current routes/layout)
- Keep styling consistent with the current design system/components already used in LandingPage.tsx
- Do NOT add new heavy dependencies. If you need meta tags, prefer react-helmet-async only if already present; otherwise implement with document.title + meta tags in a small utility component.
- The article should load fast, be readable, and mobile-friendly.

Tasks:

1) Create a new route/page:
- Path: /blog/why-website-change-monitors-fail-silently
- File: client/src/pages/BlogWhyMonitorsFail.tsx (or the equivalent location in this repo)
- Ensure the route is wired into the router.

2) Put the article content into that page as semantic HTML:
- One H1
- Use H2 headings matching the article sections
- Use short paragraphs and lists where appropriate
- Include a CTA near the end linking to the app:
  “Try FetchTheChange (free plan includes up to 5 monitored pages)” linking to the dashboard/signup.

3) SEO:
- Set <title>:
  “Why Website Change Monitors Fail Silently on JavaScript-Heavy Sites | FetchTheChange”
- Add meta description:
  “Most website change monitors fail silently when JavaScript or CSS selectors break. Learn why this happens and how to detect it before you miss important changes.”
- Add Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:type=article, og:url)
- Add Twitter card tags (twitter:card=summary, twitter:title, twitter:description)

4) Canonical:
- Add canonical link tag for this page:
  https://fetch-the-change.replit.app/blog/why-website-change-monitors-fail-silently
(If the deployed domain differs, use an env var like PUBLIC_BASE_URL with fallback to window.location.origin.)

5) Optional but recommended: JSON-LD structured data
- Add script type="application/ld+json" with schema.org BlogPosting:
  - headline (same as H1)
  - description (same as meta description)
  - author: “Christian Ustvedt Kavli”
  - publisher: “FetchTheChange”
  - mainEntityOfPage: canonical URL
  - datePublished: use the Dev.to publish date if known, otherwise today’s date in ISO
  - dateModified: today’s date in ISO

6) Add a link from the landing page:
- In LandingPage.tsx, add a small “Learn why monitors fail silently” link (or button) that navigates to the blog page.
- Place it under the hero section or near the screenshot section.
- Text: “Read: Why monitors fail silently on JavaScript-heavy sites”
- Keep it subtle but visible.

7) Content:
Use the full article text from the Dev.to page, but slightly adapted for the website:
- Remove Dev.to-specific phrasing
- Keep the core narrative and section order
- Keep it factual and non-hypey
- Keep the final discussion questions

8) Add a small “Back to home” link at the top and bottom of the article page.

After implementation:
- Confirm which files were created/modified
- Provide the final article page URL path
- Confirm that meta tags/canonical render correctly (at least in code)
